# Licence & Disclaimer…
The ENGINE binary is designed ONLY for legitimate and lawful multimedia solutions and is provided AS IS with ZERO warranty. It also contains very strong cryptographic technologies which might not be allowed to be imported in your country. By using this software, whether you are the GUEST author or the END user, you accept that the ENGINE author (me) and ALL the authors of ALL the components listed in the credits disclaim ALL liability for how the GUEST author or the END user chooses to use this software.

The ENGINE source code was supplied for REFERENCE ONLY so people can confidently trust the projects I make with it and try to help me improve it if necessary. However, it is also public as a result so I cannot stop anyone from doing what they want with it. My hope is that if you ONLY do good things with this software, then it would be greatly appreciated if you could be as so kind as to credit me and help improve the source code farther.
